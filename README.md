# Word count app for Django 2.x

## DESCRIPTION:

A wordcount app that removes characters you don't want *(  ,  .  ;  :  '  "  and so on)*.

**If you want any character removed:** Add the single string you don't want into the *delete_values* list.

You could modify this function to filter certain words. Doing so would simplify the function more.
